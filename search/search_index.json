We take care of creating branded corporate clothing for our customers, business gifts and also take care of the online side for them, managing the marketing and possibly the websites.  </p> <p>How did we end up making discord apps? We love discord, not only because it allows us to work great but also to create an amazing community directly with our customers. However, as the work increased, the platform alone began to not be enough for us and we decided to invest in the creation of an app that would allow us to bring our productivity even higher... and so Team Tasks Manager was born.  </p> <p>It has literally changed our lives, total control of all workflows and relax thanks to the reminder function which allows us not having to double check everything every day for fear of forgetting something.</p> <p>We handle dozens of orders a month that require the coordination of nearly 20 employees and with this app we can do it without any problems.</p> <p>Given the tangible benefits we obtained, we asked ourselves why not allow other teams to benefit from them too? And so our adventure in the Discord world began..</p>"},{"location":"#get-support","title":"Get support","text":"<p>Join our Discord server to report bugs, suggest new features, or simply get support.
