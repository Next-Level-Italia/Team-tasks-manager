# Welcome to Team Tasks Manager

The Team Tasks Manager discord app (hereinafter abbreviated as TTM) improves team coordination by sharing and managing tasks within the Discord platform. 

{==

  If you’re having trouble coordinating your team and need a solution that will keep you on Discord, you’ve come to **the right place**.  

==}

TTM allows you to easily manage a centralized and shared list of tasks with a simple and intuitive interface.  
In detail, you can:

:material-arrow-right-bold: assign tasks to people and/or roles  
:material-arrow-right-bold: add people and/or roles to the task to tag upon completion  
:material-arrow-right-bold: define reminders, delegating the burden of remembering important events to the app

Here are some of the features we are working on:

:material-progress-helper: ability to view only the tasks you own  
:material-progress-helper: dashboard that summarizes the progress of all the lists  
:material-progress-helper: and much more..

***All you have to do is invite the app and try it out!***

## Names convention

Some of the terms we will use throughout this guide are grouped below:

| Term          | Definition |
| :------------ | :-------   |
| Task          | identifies any type of simple activity (i.e. which is neither a subtask nor a task group)   |
| Subtask       | identifies a sub-activity (i.e. an activity belonging to a larger one)  |
| Task group    | identifies an activity composed of sub-activities  |


## User Experience

Our philosophy is to exploit the graphic component of discord as much as possible, making the use of the app as simple and intuitive as possible. 

In fact you will find in TTM, in total contrast to other apps, only two slash commands. All the features are activated by graphic components and are also designed to require the minimum number of actions.

We also favor the use of widely known icons to put users immediately at ease.

## About us

**We are Next Level Italia S.A.S., an Italian startup that works mainly in the advertising sector.**  
We take care of creating branded corporate clothing for our customers, business gifts and also take care of the online side for them, managing the marketing and possibly the websites.  

**How did we end up making discord bots?**  
We love discord, not only because it allows us to work great but also to create an amazing community directly with our customers.
However, as the work increased, the platform alone began to not be enough for us and we decided to invest in the creation of an app that would allow us to bring
our productivity even higher... and so **Team Tasks Manager** was born.  

{==

It has literally changed our lives, total control of all workflows and relax thanks to the reminder function which allows us not having to double check everything every day for fear of forgetting something.

==}

We handle dozens of orders a month that require the coordination of nearly 20 employees and with this app we can do it without any problems.

_Given the tangible benefits we obtained, we asked ourselves why not allow other teams to benefit from them too?
**And so our adventure in the Discord world began..**_:slight_smile:
