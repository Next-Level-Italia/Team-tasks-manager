# Introduction

The following section explains how to execute the commands, if you are familiar with this you can skip and go directly to /create-list.

## How to execute slash commands

There are two main ways to activate slash commands, I'll show you both below.  

{==

Team Tasks Manager commands do not require input, so one click is enough to use them.

==}

### Type /

The first is to write / (slash) in the space dedicated to writing.

![name](../assets/how-to/lhtcmd1.png#only-light){ align=left }
![name](../assets/how-to/dhtcmd1.png#only-dark){ align=left }

What you need to do is:  

1.  To type, in the space dedicated to writing, the / (slash),  
1.  From the list of apps select TTM to get focus on the commands,  
1.  Select the command. 

!!! tip

    After the first step, discord suggests the most used commands at the top, allowing you to start them immediately, it's a pretty good tip.

If there are many apps on the server, we recommend typing at least part of the command name to filter them and see only the ones you're interested in.


### App Launcher

The second way is to click on app launcher icon ![name](../assets/how-to/appLauncher.png){ width="18" }

![name](../assets/how-to/lhtcmd2.png#only-light){ align="left"; width="360" }
![name](../assets/how-to/dhtcmd2.png#only-dark){ align="left"; width="360" }

what you need to do is:

1. Click on the icon icon ![name](../assets/how-to/appLauncher.png){ width="18" },  
1. In the **Apps on this Server** section select Team Tasks Manager,  
1. At this point you will arrive at this screen where you will have to select the desired command.

!!! tip

    Again, once you've done the first step, discord will suggest the most used apps. Search for the Team Tasks Manager app in this section before searching for it.
