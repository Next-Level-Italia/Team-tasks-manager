The Team Tasks Manager discord app (hereinafter abbreviated as TTM) improves team coordination by sharing and managing tasks within the Discord platform. 

{==

  If you’re having trouble coordinating your team and need a solution that will keep you on Discord, you’ve come to **the right place**.

TTM allows you to easily manage a centralized and shared list of tasks with a simple and intuitive interface.  
In detail, you can:

:material-arrow-right-bold: assign tasks to people and/or roles  
:material-arrow-right-bold: add people and/or roles to the task to tag upon completion  
:material-arrow-right-bold: define reminders, delegating the burden of remembering important events to the app

Here are some of the features we are working on:

:material-progress-helper: ability to view only the tasks you own  
:material-progress-helper: dashboard that summarizes the progress of all the lists  
:material-progress-helper: and much more..

You just have to bring it to your server and try it!
