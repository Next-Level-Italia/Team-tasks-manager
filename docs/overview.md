The Team Tasks Manager discord app (hereinafter abbreviated as TTM) improves team coordination by sharing and managing tasks within the Discord platform. 

If you are having trouble coordinating your team and need a solution that allows you to stay on Discord, then you are in the right place.

TTM allows you to easily manage a centralized and shared list of tasks with a simple and intuitive interface. In detail, you can:

- assign tasks to people and/or roles
- add people and/or roles to the task to tag upon completion
- define reminders, delegating the burden of remembering important events to the app

Here are some of the features we are working on:

- ability to view only the tasks you own
- dashboard that summarizes the progress of all the lists
- and much more..

You just have to bring it to your server and try it!
